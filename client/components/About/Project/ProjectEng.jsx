            Rāhuitia comes from the passive form of the te reo word Rāhui, which stresses that we must Rāhui in order to respect mana whenua, mana moana, and mana tangata. The intention of this website and app is to provide a platform for all iwi and hapū to register and display coordinates and information relating to rāhui and other kaupapa relating to the landscape. The app has the ambition to distribute knowledge, create consciousness and promote the aforementioned respect amongst all people of Aotearoa/New Zealand.

          <p className="aboutBody">
            The app firstly allows users to register and create a profile that contains information relating to their whakapapa/genealogy. Once a user is authenticated they can then add a rāhui, wether it be current or historical to the map of Aotearoa/New Zealand. This can be on behalf of their iwi, hapū, themselves or someone else. By drawing and defining the territory that the rāhui applies to, the user can communicate what areas to be mindful and respectful toward.
